# Gearworks SDK
The Gearworks SDK (or Gearworks Software Development Kit, or GWSDK) was created to store any necessary textures or resources for a Gearworks Project.

## Changelog
Like in the root README.md file, you can view the history of the Gearworks SDK in the CHANGELOG.md file, linked [here](CHANGELOG.md).

## Using the GWSDK
Most resources in the SDK will be used automatically by the engine in its own code. However, you can also use the files in it, simply by referring to them in your own code via a relative path, just like any other resource. Just keep the `GWSDK` folder in your project (which is necessary for the engine to work, anyway) and you have everything ready to go.
